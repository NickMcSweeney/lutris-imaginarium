What is it that excites you?

What about you makes you a good fit?
I have good intuition, I learn quickly and work hard to do it.
I do my work because I think what I do is interesting, not for the grades or the money.
I am fascinated by security, privacy and how people think, so working with a privacy focused search engine is about as cool as you get.
In my current work I work very closely with UI/UX designers on predevelopment and proof of concept projects.
I am a very self directed worker. I function well in environments where I have low levels of direction.

What is the most impactful improvement?
Local user profiles. Allow data to be saved locally to create user profiles that provide personalized search results.
Possible implementation could be through creation of a "Super Cookie"
This should be done because it provides an answer to the biggest complaint that people have about a search engine that doesn't track you.
People are used to having their search engine "know" them and provide results tailored specifically them.
I think that you can give people the power to have a profile that they have 100% control of that doesn't compromise their privacy.
The main issue I see is that this would mean that when someone makes a search there would be a larger amount of data processing.
However I think that to a large degree this could function like having a remotely located database.


Any questions?

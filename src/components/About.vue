      bodyText: ["Hello,","It’s good to meet you, this is Nicholas Shindler. Nicholas, called Nick by his mother and Shindler by just about everyone else, is a young man just entering the adult world, regardless of how he feels about the idea. Nicholas is characterized by a number of principals, hard work, experimentation, intuition, and a smidge of good old fashion stubbornness, but not quite so much as many would consider cumbersome."," Nicholas studied Chemistry at university, during this time he learned many fascinating things, however none as useful as the ability to sit in the basements of old brick buildings and play with electronics.","After university, he began work, though not in the field of chemistry. Since finishing school Nicholas has worked at a company called Welocalize, a localization, linguistics, and technology company, among other things. Though largely specializing in the recruitment of large numbers of contract workers for outsourced projects. Nicholas began as one such contract worker, however, he quickly moved through many positions. Performing duties as a project lead, software tester, and software support, all over a period of fewer than six months, until finally being asked to join the companies software development and innovations team. Where he now works as a software engineer specializing in design and development."],
